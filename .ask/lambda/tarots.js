    `THOR, the god of thunder, he was tall and strong. His hair was red. In moments of anger sparks would fly like lightning from his beard. Mjolnir was his hammer, Crusher its name. He hurled it at his enemies the Frost Giants, with great destructive power. Thor brings you Progress, success made through endeavour, self confidence and good health. Rise up to challenges using your fury.`,
    `The Hanged Man sixteen. ODIN hung upon the branches of Yggdrasil, the sacred Tree. For nine days and nine nights he suffered. Self wounded by his spear, sacrificed by his hand, an offering unto himself. In agony and torment he stared into the bottomless depths of Niflheim, searching the dark pool in silence. Finally, with great effort, he reached down before him. His hand was chilled to the bone in the ice cold waters. With a cry of triumph he grasped the knowledge he sought, the Sacred Runes, their magic and their power. He took the Runes and he used them well. Odin asks you to give to truly receive. Exchange material comforts for spiritual advancement.`,
    `The eight of swords. I see a weaponless man surrounded by eight hostile warriors armed with swords. Odin asks you to keep working hard in the face of a apparently inescabale position. Restrictions will soon be rewarded`,
    `The Ace of Cups. A richly worked silver chalice, decorated with gold panels and bosses on colored enamel. It brings Joy and contentment; beginning of a relationship or friendship; possibly a wedding; a gift or a birth.`
