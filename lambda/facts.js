    `Vikings did not wear horned helmets. Forget almost every Viking warrior costume youve ever seen. Painters seem to have fabricated the trend during the 19th century, perhaps inspired by descriptions of northern Europeans by ancient Greek chroniclers.`,
    `Vikings were known for their excellent hygiene. Excavations of Viking sites have turned up tweezers, razors, combs and ear cleaners made from animal bones and antlers.`,
    `Vikings buried their dead in boats. In the Norse religion, valiant warriors entered festive and glorious realms after death, and it was thought that the vessels that served them well in life would help them reach their final destinations.`,
    `Viking men spent most of their time farming. This may come as a disappointment, but most Viking men brandished scythes, not swords. True, some were callous pirates who only stepped off their boats to burn villages, but the vast majority peacefully sowed barley, rye and oatsâ€”at least for part of the year`,
    `Vikings skied for fun. Norsemen regarded skiing as an efficient way to get around and a popular form of recreation. They even worshipped a god of skiing, Ullr.`
